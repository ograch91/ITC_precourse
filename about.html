        <h1>About Me</h1>
        Hey there! my name is Oren. Ever since I can remember myself, I was always  fascinated by technical things like computers and everything related.<br>
        I am an avid fan of Apple products, and a techy guy by nature, always staying up to date on the newest products and services releases by big tech-companies, such as Google, Facebook, Samsung and many others.<br>
        For the past 2 years, I wanted to develop my career and grow my passion for tech,after some research for most wanted positions the one that caught me was coding. That day started experimenting and learning some code by myself, which proved harder then expected, so I decided to look-up the best programs for coding. That's when I found out about ITC, immediately I knew I had to apply for the program and make start a new path in my career.<br>
        For the past 7 year I've been working at Partner. My most recent position is Tier 3 network and telephony expert,
